DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    The "C:\Windows\Installer" can often grow very large in size due to applications such as Microsoft
    Office being regularly patched. Superseded patches get left behind leaving them in an orphaned state.
    The MSIPatches module can detect and move the orphaned patches freeing up valuable disk space.

    This module depends on the MSI module by Heath Stewart. https://github.com/heaths/psmsi

    Install via the following method:
        Install-Package MSIPatches

    Get-Command -Module MSIPatches
